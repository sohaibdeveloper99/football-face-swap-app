## Your Fix is Ready!
‚úÖ **Code is pushed to GitHub**
‚úÖ **Fix is in the code** (trust proxy added)
‚ùå **Railway hasn't deployed it yet**

---

## How to Force Railway to Deploy:

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your project: `football-face-swap-app`
3. Click on your backend service
4. Look for a **"Redeploy"** button (usually in the top right)
5. Click it ‚Üí Wait 2-3 minutes
6. ‚úÖ Backend will restart with the fix!

### Option 2: Wait for Auto-Deploy
- Railway auto-deploys when you push to GitHub
- But sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes
- Just wait and check logs again

### Option 3: Push Another Commit
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Railway redeploy"
git push
```

---

## How to Check if It's Fixed:

### In Railway Dashboard:
- Look for logs showing: `Face Swap API server running on port 5000`
- Should NOT show: `ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header...`

### Test the API:
```bash
curl https://football-face-swap-app-production-fb73.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"OK","message":"Face Swap API is running"}
```

## ‚è∞ Next Steps:
1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Let Railway auto-deploy
2. **OR** Manually redeploy via Railway dashboard
3. **Check** https://football-face-swap-app-production-fb73.up.railway.app/api/health
4. **Test** your frontend app
