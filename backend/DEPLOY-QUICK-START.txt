HOW TO DEPLOY BACKEND TO RAILWAY (LIVE ONLINE)
===================================================

WHAT YOU'LL GET:
================
âœ… Backend accessible from anywhere (not just localhost)
âœ… Works 24/7 even when your computer is off
âœ… Gets a public URL like: https://your-app.up.railway.app
âœ… Free for small projects
âœ… Easy to setup (about 10 minutes)


REQUIREMENTS:
=============
1. GitHub account (github.com) - FREE
2. Railway account (railway.app) - FREE


STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE:
===================

STEP 1: Push Code to GitHub
---------------------------
1. Go to github.com and create new repository
2. In your project folder, run:
   
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Railway"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git push -u origin main

STEP 2: Deploy to Railway
------------------------
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Select your repository
6. Select "backend" folder
7. Click "Deploy Now"

STEP 3: Add Environment Variables
----------------------------------
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to "Variables" tab
2. Add these:
   
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   FRONTEND_URL=YOUR_FRONTEND_URL
   FACEMINT_API_KEY=your_key_from_config.env

STEP 4: Get Your Live URL
--------------------------
1. In Railway, go to "Settings"
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. Copy the URL (this is your live backend!)
4. Test it: https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health


STEP 5: Update Frontend
------------------------
Change API calls from:
   http://localhost:5000
To:
   https://your-app.up.railway.app


CONFIGURE CORS (Important!)
============================
After deploying, you need to set CORS to allow your frontend.
In Railway environment variables, set:
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
Problem: Backend won't start
Fix: Check logs in Railway dashboard, make sure all variables are set
