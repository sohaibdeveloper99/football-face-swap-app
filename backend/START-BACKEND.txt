HOW TO START YOUR BACKEND AUTOMATICALLY
==========================================

STEP 1: Run the Setup (ONE TIME ONLY)
---------------------------------------
1. Open your backend folder
2. Double-click: setup-backend-always-on.bat
3. Wait for it to finish
4. DONE!

After this, your backend will ALWAYS be running.

STEP 2: Check if it's working
---------------------------------------
Open browser and go to:
http://localhost:5000/api/health

You should see: {"status":"OK"}


WHAT HAPPENS NOW:
=================
âœ… Backend starts automatically when Windows boots
âœ… Backend keeps running even if you close terminal
âœ… Backend auto-restarts if it crashes
âœ… You NEVER need to run "npm start" again!


NEED TO START/STOP MANUALLY?
=============================
Open PowerShell in backend folder and run:

Start:   npm run pm2:start
Stop:    npm run pm2:stop  
Restart: npm run pm2:restart
Logs:    npm run pm2:logs


THAT'S IT! YOUR BACKEND IS NOW ALWAYS ON! ðŸš€
