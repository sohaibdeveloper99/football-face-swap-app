# ⏰ Waiting for New Deployment

## Current Situation:

You're looking at OLD logs (from 01:29:31 - before the fix was deployed).

The NEW code with the fix is pushing to Railway now.

---

## What You See in Old Logs:

```
✅ Face Swap API server running on port 5000
✅ Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health  
✅ API endpoints secured and rate limited
❌ Stopping Container (because health check failed)
```

This is from the OLD deployment before I fixed it.

---

## What to Do Now:

### Option 1: Wait 2-3 Minutes (Recommended)
- Don't do anything
- Wait for Railway to auto-redeploy
- Check logs after 2-3 minutes
- Should see logs WITHOUT "Stopping Container"

### Option 2: Manually Redeploy in Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your backend service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

---

## What You'll See in NEW Logs:

```
✅ Building...
✅ Installing dependencies...
✅ Face Swap API server running on port 5000
✅ Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
✅ API endpoints secured and rate limited
(Server stays running - NO "Stopping Container") ✅
```

---

## How to Know It's Fixed:

Look for logs timestamped AFTER 01:30 (current time + 2-3 minutes).

If you see:
- ✅ Server starts
- ✅ NO "Stopping Container" message
- ✅ Server keeps running

Then it's working! 🎉

---

## Test After New Deployment:

```bash
curl https://football-face-swap-app-production-a188.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return immediately with:
```json
{"status":"OK","message":"Face Swap API is running"}
```

**The old logs you're seeing are expected. Wait for NEW deployment!** ⏰
