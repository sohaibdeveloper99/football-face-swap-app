FIX RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - FIXED!
==========================================

THE PROBLEM:
- Railway is looking in the wrong folder
- It's trying to run from the ROOT directory
- But your backend code is in the "backend/" subfolder

THE SOLUTION:
You MUST set the "Root Directory" in Railway dashboard!


STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================================

1. GO TO RAILWAY DASHBOARD
   https://railway.app

2. CLICK YOUR PROJECT
   football-face-swap-app

3. CLICK YOUR BACKEND SERVICE
   (football-face-swap-app-production)

4. CLICK "Settings" TAB
   (or look for a gear icon)

5. FIND "Root Directory" FIELD
   Currently it's probably empty or has "/"

6. CHANGE IT TO:
   backend

7. CLICK "Save" BUTTON

8. WAIT 2-3 MINUTES
   Railway will automatically redeploy!


WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER:
==========================================
Logs will show:
‚úì Building backend...
‚úì Installing dependencies...
‚úì Starting server...
‚úÖ Face Swap API server running on port 5000


TEST IT:
==========================================
Visit:
https://football-face-swap-app-production-fb73.up.railway.app/api/health

You should see:
{"status":"OK","message":"Face Swap API is running"}


WHY THIS WORKS:
==========================================

BEFORE (Broken):
Railway looks at: footballswaptry/ (root)
Tries to find: server.js
Can't find it! ‚ùå

AFTER (Fixed):
Railway looks at: footballswaptry/backend/ (backend folder)
Finds: server.js ‚úÖ
Starts successfully! üéâ


NEED HELP FINDING THE SETTING?
==========================================

If you can't find "Root Directory" setting:

OPTION A: Delete and Recreate
1. Delete current service
2. Click "New" ‚Üí "GitHub"
3. Select your repo
4. When asked for "Root Directory", type: backend
5. Deploy

OPTION B: Look for these names:
- Root Directory
- Root
- Working Directory
- Source Path

Any of these can be used!


GO SET IT NOW! ‚ö°
