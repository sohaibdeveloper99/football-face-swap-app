# üîç Debug the 400 Error

## What to Do Right Now:

### Step 1: Test the Button
1. Make sure your frontend is running: `npm start`
2. Upload your face image
3. Click "Put me on this shirt"
4. **Open browser console** (Press F12)

### Step 2: Check Console for These Messages
You should see:
```
Starting advanced face swap process with backend integration...
Sending request to backend: https://football-face-swap-app-production-fb73.up.railway.app/api/faceswap
```

### Step 3: Look for Error Details
The console will show the exact error. Look for:
- Status code (should be 400)
- Error message from backend
- Request details

### Step 4: Share the Full Console Output
Copy and paste the error messages from console here.

## Quick Test Without the App:

Test the backend directly with curl:

```bash
curl https://football-face-swap-app-production-fb73.up.railway.app/api/health
```

If you see:
```json
{"status":"OK","message":"Face Swap API is running"}
```

Then the backend is working, and the issue is with how the frontend is sending the request.

## Most Likely Issues:

1. **Content-Type header** (FIXED - we removed it)
2. **Missing required fields** in FormData
3. **Incorrect file upload format**
4. **Backend CORS issue** (less likely)
