# üîß Fix: Railway Deploying Wrong Folder

## The Problem:
Railway is trying to deploy from the ROOT directory (`footballswaptry/`), but your backend is in the `backend/` subdirectory!

**That's why it's failing.** Railway can't find `server.js` in the root.

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX: Configure Railway Root Directory

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your project: `football-face-swap-app`
3. Click on your backend service
4. Go to **Settings** tab
5. Look for **Root Directory** or **Working Directory**
6. Set it to: `backend`
7. Click **Save**
8. Railway will auto-redeploy!

### Option 2: Redeploy with Correct Folder
1. In Railway dashboard, **Delete** the current service
2. Create **NEW SERVICE** from GitHub
3. When connecting, make sure to select:
   - Repository: `football-face-swap-app`
   - **Root Directory: `backend`** ‚Üê IMPORTANT!
4. Deploy

## ‚úÖ How to Set Root Directory in Railway:

2. **Click** on your backend service
3. **Settings** tab (or Configure)

## üéØ Why This Fixes It:

**Before:**
```

```
Railway looks at: footballswaptry/backend/
Runs: npm start
Finds: server.js ‚úÖ
Works! üéâ
```

## ‚ö° Quick Action:

**Go to Railway Dashboard NOW and set Root Directory to `backend`**

Then wait 2-3 minutes for redeploy!
